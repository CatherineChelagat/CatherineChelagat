<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">‚ú® I am so big on data, even have a degree in Statistics ...<br>üìö I'm currently learning javascript (love it!) ...<br>üéØ Goals: I am working towards becoming a seasoned data scientist and so I've been looking into projects and stuff. I also began working on an automation that would track a person's spending habits (budgeting)..<br>üé≤ Fun fact: I started learning coding in a very interesting way, started with Javascript and only now working my way through html and CSS ...</p>
